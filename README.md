## DatabasesProject
My final project in the Databases class was a significant learning experience that allowed me to apply my knowledge of MySQL and database management to a practical scenario. 
The project involved creating a database system that simulated the Fortnite Locker Room, where players customize their in-game characters.

The assignment required me to design a program that would interact with a MySQL database. 
Users could add, delete, or modify items in their virtual locker, which closely resembled the customization options available in the game.

This assignment contributed to my computer science and college-wide learning goals in several ways:

# To attain a system-level understanding of the computer: 
It deepened my understanding of how databases are an integral part of computer systems, and how they store and retrieve data efficiently.

# To understand the concepts and techniques of software design: 
I had to carefully plan the database structure and design the program's user interface, improving my software design skills.

# To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting:
Working on this project, I gained valuable experience in both individual and collaborative settings, 
as I worked closely with a partner to create the program where we each wrote our assigned pieces seperately and came together at the end to combine them.

# To develop effective problem solving skills:
Throughout the project, I encountered various challenges related to data modeling, SQL queries, and program functionality. 
Specifically I had one small error where I had accidentally put the SQL delete command in place of an add command
and I kept accidentally deleting almost everything in the database before I figured it out.
These obstacles allowed me to develop effective problem-solving skills as I found solutions to ensure the project's success.

In conclusion, this assignment not only enhanced my understanding of software design but also provided a comprehensive 
learning experience in various aspects of computer science, aligning with the learning goals set by the school.
